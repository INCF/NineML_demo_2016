A Docker image with everything already installed is available from Docker Hub:
https://hub.docker.com/r/apdavison/ninemldemo/

Once you have Docker installed::

    docker pull apdavison/ninemldemo
    mkdir myresults
    cd myresults
    docker run -v `pwd`:/home/docker/projects/nineml_demo_2016/results -t -i apdavison/ninemldemo /bin/bash

This will start a Docker container running the bash shell, in which you can run simulations
as described below. The directory `myresults` on your host machine will be shared with the
Docker container; data and image files generated by the simulations will be written there.
